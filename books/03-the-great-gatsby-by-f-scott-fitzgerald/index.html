		<p>The Great Gatsby, a novel that has been dissected and analyzed more times than a frog in a high school biology class. But what makes this book worthy of such scrutiny? Is it the quintessential representation of the Jazz Age? Sure. Is it a powerful exploration of the American Dream? Absolutely. But let’s not forget the drama, the scandal, and the glitz and glam that make this book such a delightful romp through the pages of history. So buckle up, dear readers, as we delve into the world of the 1920s and the enigmatic Jay Gatsby himself.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h2>
<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was no stranger to the wild and raucous lifestyles of his characters. An American powerhouse hailing from St. Paul, Minnesota, this literary legend captured the essence of the “Jazz Age” with his novels and short stories. But unlike many of his high-flying flapper characters, Fitzgerald faced his share of struggles. He married the equally talented and troubled Zelda Fitzgerald, and the two of them made a name for themselves as an intoxicated duo that lit up any scene they graced. Through financial difficulties and battles with addiction, Fitzgerald never lost his sense of humor. And thank goodness for that - it’s what made his vivid tales of glamour and excess all the more delightful. In every page of Fitzgerald’s work, you can catch the glint in his eye and the twinkle in his pen.</p>
<h2 id="main-themes">Main Themes</h2>
<p>It’s as though Fitzgerald took a giant magnifying glass and held it up to the American Dream, reveling in the cracks and blemishes. Throughout the novel, he explores the dark underbelly of the glittering façade, revealing the harsh truths about class, wealth, and power. It’s not a pretty picture, but it’s an honest one. The characters are all driven by their desires, whether it’s for money, social status, or romantic love. And yet, despite their efforts, they are unable to escape their unfulfilled dreams. The novel shows that in a world where success is measured by material possessions, happiness is an elusive and fleeting thing.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald’s portrayal of the wealthy elite is both scathing and sympathetic. He shows the reader the frivolous, careless lives they lead, but also their vulnerability to the same societal pressures that weigh on everyone else. The characters’ obsession with material possessions and status symbols is a reflection of the culture they live in, where success is defined by what you own, not who you are. The novel is a cautionary tale about the dangers of equating wealth with worth, and the corrosive effects of chasing after a superficial dream.</p>
<p>Love is also a central theme of the novel, and Fitzgerald explores the different forms it can take. Romantic love is shown to be both powerful and destructive, as characters are consumed by their passion and unable to see the reality of their situations. But there are also more platonic forms of love, such as the friendship between Nick and Gatsby, and the deep connection between Gatsby and his father. These relationships are a reminder that love can take many forms, and that it’s not always about grand gestures and dramatic declarations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the novel is about the human condition, and the struggles we all face to find meaning and purpose in a world that often seems meaningless and chaotic. Fitzgerald’s message is a somber one, but it’s also a hopeful one. Despite the characters’ failures and disillusionment, there are glimpses of a better world, where people are judged by their character rather than their bank balance. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always light to be found.</p>
<h2 id="key-characters">Key Characters</h2>
<p>It’s not uncommon to find a protagonist that is obsessed with love, a love that they had lost, and a love that they’re determined to win back at any cost. This seems to be the case with Jay Gatsby, the protagonist in the book under review. Gatsby is wealthy, famous, and charismatic, but all of that is overshadowed by his obsession with Daisy Buchanan. Daisy, on the other hand, represents the American Dream- wealth, status, and privilege. She’s a woman who can have anything she desires, and Gatsby, it seems, is only one of those things.</p>
<p>The narrator of the book, Nick Carraway, is essential to the story because he provides a window into a world that very few of us get to see- the world of the wealthy and their decadent lifestyle. His presence allows readers to see the excesses and indulgences of the elite, as well as the darker aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>Tom Buchanan, Daisy’s husband, is another crucial character in the book. Tom is a member of the old-money social elite, and he represents the opposite of Gatsby in almost every way. Where Gatsby is self-made and charismatic, Tom is entitled and proud of his wealth and status.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Myrtle Wilson, Tom Buchanan’s mistress. Myrtle is a working-class woman who desires to climb the social ladder, and Tom seems to represent an opportunity for her to achieve that. Her desire for wealth and status is as intense as Gatsby’s love for Daisy, and her ambition, like his obsession, will ultimately lead to her downfall.</p>
<p>These four key characters are essential to the book’s plot and themes, and their interaction with one another forms the basis of the story.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Ah, the tangled web we weave when we set our sights on unattainable love. The Great Gatsby is the perfect example of how obsession can lead to disastrous consequences. We follow the tragic love story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, a married woman he is still enamoured with, like a moth to a flame. Throw in her pompous husband Tom, and we have ourselves a love triangle that is more tangled than a ball of yarn after an intense cat fight. As Nick Carraway narrates their story, we see how Gatsby’s entire existence revolves around winning Daisy’s heart. But at what cost? His determination clouds his judgment, and he gets tangled up in lies and deceit. This novel is equal parts heart-wrenching and frustrating as we watch Gatsby’s single-minded pursuit of Daisy overshadow everything else, and ultimately, lead to tragedy. It’s a cautionary tale of the dangers of letting our obsessions get the best of us.</p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>Looking at Fitzgerald’s writing style in ‘The Great Gatsby’, it’s hard not to be drawn in by the sheer beauty of his words. He effortlessly weaves lush descriptors into his prose, creating vivid imagery that stays with the reader long after they’ve put the book down. But it’s not just the poetics that make his style stand out - it’s the way he plays with structure, too. Moving back and forth in time with the present-day action and flashbacks, he manages to capture the elusive nature of memory, making the reader feel as though they too are caught up in the cyclical, never-ending stream of time. It’s no wonder that ‘The Great Gatsby’ is considered a modernist novel, as Fitzgerald’s style is nothing if not experimental. His writing is a testament to the power of words to not only convey meaning, but to emotionally move and inspire those who come into contact with them.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>As “The Great Gatsby” made its debut, the world was smack-dab in the middle of the Roaring Twenties, an era often remembered for the dazzling, frivolous facade that masked its underlying social conflicts. On the surface, this period was marked by the proliferation of jazz music, illegal alcohol during prohibition, fashion developments, and other affluence-driven extravagance. However, the wealthy upper class’s hedonistic lifestyle came at the expense of the lower classes, who experienced rising unemployment and poverty rates. This was a time of heart-wrenching social changes, especially for women and racial minorities demanding equal rights, and the gnawing aftermath of World War I. The notable rise of the middle class and booming industrial progress formed a backdrop for Fitzgerald’s iconic novel.</p>
<h2 id="peculiarities">Peculiarities</h2>
<p>Every classic work has its own peculiarities that make it unique and interesting in its own way. In ‘The Great Gatsby,’ F. Scott Fitzgerald introduces us to a whole new world of symbolism. Take the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock, for instance. It symbolizes Gatsby’s unattainable dream. The color green, here, represents hope and aspiration, something that Gatsby longs for but can never truly achieve. Moreover, Fitzgerald cleverly employs parallelism between the story of Gatsby and his own life. Both Gatsby and Fitzgerald were obsessed with the idea of wealth and success, driven by their desire to be accepted by the upper echelons of society.</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-message">Fundamental Message</h2>
<p>The American Dream is often touted as the ultimate goal in life, the prize of having it all: money, fame, and power. However, The Great Gatsby shatters this illusion with a powerful warning: that the unbridled pursuit of wealth and social status can be a corrupt and dangerous path to follow. Gatsby’s desperate search for love and status ultimately leads to his downfall, illustrating how the American Dream can be a delusion that blinds its followers to reality.</p>
<p>Moreover, the novel also explores how American society can disintegrate when it becomes consumed with materialism and consumerism. The characters in the book are obsessed with money and status symbols, completely ignoring the importance of empathy and community. The result is a society that’s disconnected from each other, where individuals are more concerned with their own needs than the well-being of the collective. This is a profound observation that remains just as relevant today as it was when the novel was first published.</p>
<p>The message is clear: the American Dream is a mirage and the pursuit of wealth and status has its consequences. Fitzgerald’s warning rings true, challenging us to reassess our own values and priorities, and to remember that happiness cannot be found in material possessions alone.</p>
<p><code>***</code></p>
<p>As I finish my commentary on “The Great Gatsby,” I realize that this novel is truly a masterful creation. It’s a story that embodies so many elements of American life, both then and now. Fitzgerald’s commentary on the American Dream and its failure is perfectly woven into the tale of Gatsby and his tragic ending. The symbolism within the novel is staggering, from the green light that represents hope and longing, to the Valley of Ashes that symbolizes decay and moral corruption.</p>
<p>But what stands out to me most is Fitzgerald’s writing style. He has an incredible ability to create vivid scenes and characters that we can’t help but become emotionally attached to. Even the minor characters are so perfectly crafted that they add depth and complexity to the story. Through his use of parallelism, Fitzgerald examines how the lives of people on opposite ends of the class spectrum intersect and ultimately intertwine.</p>
<p>“The Great Gatsby” is an enduring classic because it is a reflection of the America we know and love. It speaks to our hopes and our fears, our dreams and our failures. And just like Gatsby himself, it is a story that will never grow old or lose its ability to captivate and enthrall us.</p>
